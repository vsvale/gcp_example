- BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. With BigQuery you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to manage or needing a database administrator. BigQuery uses SQL and can take advantage of the pay-as-you-go model. BigQuery allows you to focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights.

## Batch load
- CSV, JSON, AVRO, DATASTORE_BACKUP, PARQUET, ORC, GZIP
- Load compress files is not fast as uncompressed files
- AVRO auto detect schema, CSV and JSON best verify auto infer
- Automate setting up Cloud Functions to listen to a Cloud Storage event that is associated with new files arriving in a given bucket and launch a BigQuery load job

- Nested array fields and STRUCT fields allow for differing data granularity in the same table
